* Configure how epw send the data to next epc
* Add a builder module which connects all epc:s (configures the epc:s)
  - epc passes the informtion down to the children when they are
    started as args to the supervisor
* Route messages in epc to workers for
  * Hash on key X
  * one worker per key, create workers dynamically when needed
* Add a EmitFun to the process method, to be used to send data to next
  processing unit.
* Add loop detection, add timestamp when they enter the system.  That
  can also be used to measure the latency of the configuration.
* add possibility for worker to give ets table to epc
