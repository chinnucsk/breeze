* Make the epw register with the epc when it is started and gets the
  configuration as a reply.  epc stores it in a tuple (one element per
  worker), this is to handle restarts and keyhashcasting.  epc needs
  to cache data during a worker restart.
* Configure how epw send the data to next epc
* Add a builder module which connects all epc:s (configures the epc:s)
  - epc passes the informtion down to the children when they are
    started as args to the supervisor
* epc monitors the workers and update its list when they restarted?
* Route messages in epc to workers for
  * Hash on key X
* Add loop detection, add timestamp when they enter the system.  That
  can also be used to measure the latency of the configuration.
* Replace all headers to the edoc versions, from the emacs templates
  in erlang otp
